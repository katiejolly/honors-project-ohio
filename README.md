# Overview of the project

This repository is a collection of work from my honors project (2018).

It currently contains folders including:

- R/ (scripts for data analysis)
  - plots/ (plots created from R scripts)
  - data/ (data created by R scripts and used in R scripts)
- articles/ (background research and subject-matter readings)
- shp/ (shapefile of Ohio precincts from [MGGG's github repository](https://www.github.com/mggg/ohio-precincts))

The Ohio shapefile is a product of the [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group](http://gerrydata.org/) through the Voting Rights Data Institute.
